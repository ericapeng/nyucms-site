## About Chinese Mei Society

CMS was originally founded in 1988 as an acapella group.

The "Mei" in Chinese Mei Society originates from the word æ¢…, which means plum blossom. Just like a plum blossom, the founders of CMS hoped for the club to blossom at New York University. CMS is a club dedicated to building a community connected by Chinese and Chinese-American culture.

Some of our annual events include Spooky Foods Festival, Holiday Soiree, Bubble Tea Tasting, and Yuan.
